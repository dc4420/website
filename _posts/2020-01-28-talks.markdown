# Seasons Greetings!

Best wishes to all our speakers and attendees for Christmas and the New Year ahead. Thanks you all so much for attending.

Sorry the organisers are each fighting off various manifestations of winter lurgi, and haven't been able to arrange an Xmas drink/meal gathering this year.

However we will be back on 28th January, and we will be updating the website with speaker details soon.

We're always happy for more talks, so if you've implemented Meltdown on your smartwatch,
want to walk us through the highlights of a CTF, or have some insight into upcoming privacy
regulations, we're interested!

Drop a message to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with a title,
synopsis and rough length, and don't worry if you haven't spoken before.
