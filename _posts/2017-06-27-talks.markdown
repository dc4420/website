# 1st Talk

## SHA-3 vs the world

### Speaker

David Wong, [@lyon01_david](https://twitter.com/lyon01_david)

### Synopsis

Since Keccak has been selected as the winner of the SHA-3 competition in 2012, a myriad of different hash functions have been trending. From BLAKE2 to KangarooTwelve we'll cover what hash functions are out there, what is being used, and what you should use. Extending hash functions, we'll also discover STROBE, a symmetric protocol framework derived from SHA-3.

# 2nd Talk

## Building a small supercomputer for fun and (mostly) profit

### Speaker

Yvan Janssens, [@friedkiwi](https://twitter.com/friedkiwi)

### Synopsis

Cryptocurrency mining is currently having a big boom again, and so many people are building GPU rigs that the supply of AMD and nvidia GPUs is running dry. I'm planning to give a short talk about how I build my 50 GPU farm, the challenges I faced and how I've overcome them while maintaining structural integrity and fire safety precautions in my flat. I'll also cover the tiny little hacks I've done to be even more frugal, and lower the BOM of each rig to the tiniest amount of possible while minimising risk and maximising profit.
