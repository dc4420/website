## XFLTReaT tunnelling framework

### Speaker

Balazs Bucsay ([@xoreipeip](https://twitter.com/xoreipeip))

### Synopsis

XFLTReaT is a Python based tunnelling framework that unifies all tunnelling tools
that are out there. It already supports many protocols and more are coming. It is
really convenient to use, open-sourced and a should be community developed. The
newest two additions are the split tunnelling feature that gives you the opportunity
to only access a set of IPs over the tunnel and the RDP module which allows you to
test over RDP jump boxes. By combining these two, it is now possible to test
segregated network from your favourite Kali, Minix or GNU Hurd box.

A few short demos will be included in the presentation to show the power behind the framework.
