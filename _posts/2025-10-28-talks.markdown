# First talk

## Lodestar Forge

### Speaker

[Jamie Pegg](https://linkedin.com/in/jamiepegg)

### Synopsis

An introduction to Lodestar Forge — quickly deploy, configure, and manage red teaming infrastructure through a
fast and modern platform. Deploying dedicated infrastructure for red teams shouldn't be a headache; that’s why I created
Lodestar Forge. I will be talking through some of the key features of the platform and performing a live demo.

# Future talks

We're still trying to build up a backlog of talks. If you've implemented a C2 on a smartwatch, want to walk us through the highlights of a CTF, or have some insight into the breakdown of security cooperation globally, we're interested!

Drop a message to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with a title, synopsis and rough length, and don't worry if you haven't presented before.

We're also happy to host other activities, like lockpicking, or demoing a new piece of kit, just let us know.

# New location

We are no longer at the Phoenix! The next meeting will be at:

**The Greene Man**<br/>
383 Euston Road<br/>
London NW1 3AU

Closest stations: Great Portland Street, Warren Street, Euston.

We'll start around 7:30pm as usual, but feel free to turn up from 6:30pm to settle in.
