# Talk

## Web browsing from a car, what is the worse that can happen?

### Speaker

Ian Tabor ([@mintynet](https://twitter.com/mintynet)), [www.mintynet.com](https://www.mintynet.com)

### Synopsis

Car hacking and the discovery of a vulnerability in a In Vehicle Infotainment Unit, showing the process of disclosure to the manufacturer and their response. Also the further work I am doing to see if the vulnerability could be exploited more than just the issues originally found, some tips on how others could 'hack' there IVI. In the process of building a car on the bench for other car hacking. There may be a demo of the hack using a similar IVI running outside of the vehicle.
