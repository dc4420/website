# Second Talk

## The Art of Defeating Facial Recognition

### Speaker

Vic Harkness ([@VicHarkness](https://twitter.com/VicHarkness)) ([website](https://vicharkness.co.uk/))

### Synopsis

Privacy is not just an issue of interest to techies.  People within the art community are not happy with the idea of ubiquitous facial recognition systems, leading some people to develop techniques to defeat said systems.  This talk will provide a high-level overview of the general techniques used by facial recognition systems, and discuss some of the methodologies being used to defeat them (with special attention being paid to artistic solutions).

We're always happy for more talks, so if you've implemented Meltdown on your smartwatch,
want to walk us through the highlights of a CTF, or have some insight into upcoming privacy
regulations, we're interested!

Drop a message to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with a title,
synopsis and rough length, and don't worry if you haven't spoken before.
