# Second Talk

## One Man's Weapons against Ads and Trackers

### Speaker

Paco Hope ([@pacohope](https://twitter.com/pacohope))

### Synopsis

Paco's got a bee in his bonnet about ads and trackers. They're everywhere. They're in your mobile apps, every web page you go to, embedded devices you use like home automation devices, and even video game consoles. There are a few ways to combat them: ad blockers installed in your mobile phone or browser, online services that offer DNS blacklisting, and devices you install in your home to filter your requests. In this talk Paco will describe the tools he uses at home and on his devices to block tons of ads. In an average week, his internet connection sees about 97,000 DNS queries 14% of are blocked as ads or trackers. We'll have a look across all the different services you can use, how much they cost (most are free or donation-oriented), and which devices they can help. Not only do some web pages load faster when ads are blocked (though some load slower), the whole online experience is a calmer one. This isn't necessarily comprehensive, it's also opinionated. You probably know a few things he doesn't. But this is one man's collections of weapons in the fight.
