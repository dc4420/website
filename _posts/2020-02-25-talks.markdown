# First talk

## The problem with space junk

### Speaker

Vic Harkness ([@VicHarkness](https://twitter.com/VicHarkness)) ([website](https://vicharkness.co.uk/))

### Synopsis

Earlier this month, there was a near-miss of two satellites.  A lot of people didn't really pay attention, because why does it matter?  They were both inactive, we don't need them.  Vic, who is in no way qualified to do so, is here to tell you why you should care.

This talk will cover the problem of space junk, and the risks associated with it.  It will also highlight some particularly interesting pieces of space junk, and what's being done to address the issue.  

# Second talk

### Speaker

You?

## Synopsis


We're looking for talks for this month, so if you've implemented Meltdown on your smartwatch,
want to walk us through the highlights of a CTF, or have some insight into upcoming privacy
regulations, we're interested!

Drop a message to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with a title,
synopsis and rough length, and don't worry if you haven't spoken before.
