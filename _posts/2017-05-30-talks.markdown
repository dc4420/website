# 1st Talk

## Building Your Own Tor-centric ISP for Fun and (non)Profit

### Speaker

Gareth Llewellyn, [@NetworkString](https://twitter.com/NetworkString)

### Synopsis

Following the Snowden revelations and the UK government's revival
of the Snooper's Charter legislation, Gareth was one of many people who
accepted the EFF Tor challenge. Unfortunately, many UK ISPs' colocation
providers do not appreciate Tor exits and, after several abruptly
terminated servers, he decided to build his own privacy centric,
non-profit ISP so he could operate Tor exits and offer Unix shells, etc.
on his own terms. This talk explores the process of becoming a local
Internet registry in Europe, dealing with RIR polices such as IPv4
exhaustion, Tor abuse complaints, and the deployment of a broadband
product that only has a Tor bridge instead of a next hop at the end
of a DSL connection.
