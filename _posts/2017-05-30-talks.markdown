Talks wanted for our May meeting!

Typically we have a ~1 hour serious talk and after a short break ~30 minute talk which could be InfoSec, other technology, or a less technical theme.

We welcome a variety of subjects of interest to InfoSec people, whether you are an expert or novice asking for help with your projects, including security techniques, cryptography, incident response, law & policy, privacy, safety, data protection, social context, or social engineering.

We host a mix of experienced and novice presenters, maybe practicing part of your presentation before a bigger conference, or bringing back to London a talk you have presented overseas.

The goal of DC4420 meetings is to share some time and knowledge with people who share our interests.
