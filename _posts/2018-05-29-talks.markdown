# First Talk

## Intended Consequences

Usability with, and in face of, auditors.

### Speaker

Mika Bostr√∂m

### Synopsis

The unholy trinity of security, usability and auditor
agreeableness comes off as an extreme tradeoff, with one out of three
considered an acceptable compromise. This talk covers an approach, with
real examples, that has made it possible to cover all three at the same
time.

We're always happy for more talks, so if you've implemented Meltdown on your smartwatch,
want to walk us through the highlights of a CTF, or have some insight into upcoming privacy
regulations, we're interested!

synopsis and rough length, and don't worry if you haven't spoken before.
