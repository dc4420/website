# Talk

## *TBC*


<hr>

# Second Talk

## Pimp My Pi

### Speaker

Yvan Janssens ([@friedkiwi](https://twitter.com/friedkiwi))

### Synopsis

How far can you push today's Raspberry Pis with the average shack set of tools? This talk will venture into the amount of extra performance you can squeeze out a Raspberry Pi 3B and a Raspberry Pi 3B+ by approaching the limits of overclocking as close as possible. No Pi's have been harmed during the process.

We're always happy for more talks, so if you've implemented Meltdown on your smartwatch,
want to walk us through the highlights of a CTF, or have some insight into upcoming privacy
regulations, we're interested!

Drop a message to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with a title,
synopsis and rough length, and don't worry if you haven't spoken before.
