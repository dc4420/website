# Second Talk

## Look ma, no head!

### Speaker

Mika Bostr√∂m

### Synopsis

The weird, funny and confusing lessons learned from building
an always-on, headless vulnerability scanner. May answer questions you didn't want to ask. Likely to question answers you did.

We're always happy for more talks, so if you've implemented Meltdown on your smartwatch,
want to walk us through the highlights of a CTF, or have some insight into upcoming privacy
regulations, we're interested!

Drop a message to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with a title,
synopsis and rough length, and don't worry if you haven't spoken before.
