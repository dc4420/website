# 1st Talk

##  Hackers gonna hack - But why?

### Speaker

Helen Thackray, PhD Researcher (@ ([@hel_ty](https://twitter.com/hel_ty))

### Synopsis

This talk will explore how social science should be used to improve understanding of actors involved in an information 
security incident and how this can help the info-sec community. There are wide social psychological processes that 
influence everyone who takes part in online communities. These processes are important; they determine how we understand, 
perceive and interact with the members of our own group and the groups around us. It will be discussed how, regardless 
of how much of an anarchist or rebel we might be, individuals are strongly influenced by the norms and identity of their 
group - and whether this is a good thing or not. This talk will give examples of the significance of the group processes 
in trust, decision making and risk with in online hacking communities, and the parallels with the info-sec community. 
The talk will conclude by sharing some the data collected for this project as well as the reactions of the communities 
to the research.

Second talk wanted for our February meeting!

Typically we have a ~1 hour InfoSec talk and after a short break ~30 minute talk which could be InfoSec, other technology, or a less technical theme.

We welcome a variety of subjects of interest to InfoSec people, whether you are an expert or novice asking for help with your projects, including security techniques, cryptography, incident response, law & policy, privacy, safety, data protection, social context, social engineering.

We host a mix of experienced and novice presenters, maybe practicing part of your presentation before a bigger conference, or bringing back to London a talk you have presented overseas.

The goal of DC4420 meetings is to share some time and knowledge with people who share our interests.
