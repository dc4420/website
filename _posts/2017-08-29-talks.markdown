# 1st Talk

## Is visualization still necessary?

### Speaker

Bigezy ([@bigezy_](https://twitter.com/@bigezy_))

### Synopsis

As researchers we all struggle and push the limits of available data
visualization libraries. Availability of real time network flows have
exceeded the capacity of current visualization libraries and the
ability of the human to grasp densely visualized information.
How much data is too much? We will explore the current state of the
art in visualization as we try to answer the question of how to
visualize backbone level enterprise data.
