### Speaker

Glyn Wintle ([@glynwintle](https://twitter.com/glynwintle))

### Synopsis

Zen Mobile is a enterprise mobile device management system provided by Citrix. It has a few problems. Glyn will talk you through exploiting it, what Citrix did to fix it and what Citrix does not consider to be a problem. (Hint Glyn does not agree, come along and decide for yourselves).

Glyn will also be talking though techniques for exploiting systems and corporate networks with out leaving a forensic finger print.
