# First Talk

## Hackers gonna hack: Research Conclusions

### Speaker

Dr Helen Thackray ([@hel_ty](https://twitter.com/hel_ty))

### Synopsis

Over the course of 3 years I have studied hacking communities for my PhD research. Investigating the social psychology present online, such as how being part of a group effects individuals, and the concept of the "hacker" social identity, I will try to explain my finding in answer to the question - what makes someone a hacker? From 4chan to DefCon, surveys and interviews, I have concluded my research, and I'd like to share what I've learnt with the community that has helped me so much.
