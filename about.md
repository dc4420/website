## Dates

Meetings are normally the last Tuesday of the month, except December. Talks start at 7:30pm, but we have the room from about 6:30pm. We recommend turning up a little early to grab a drink and settle in.

New attendees welcome, just come along!
(There are no entry fees, and no tickets to book.)

If you'd like to be reminded of future events, add [the ical feed](/feed.ics) to your calendar.

## Rules

18+ Sorry, the pub's license only allows people 18 and over after 6pm.

Please be respectful to our speakers, other attendees, and the venue staff.

## Speakers Wanted

Typically our programme has a primary talk of ~45 minutes, and lighter talk ~30 minutes.
This isn't a hard structure, feel free to propose a lightning talk or Q&A
discussion if that works for your topic.

We're also happy to host activities other than talks, such as hands-on workshop or an infosec pub quiz, or something else relevant to our techie audience!

The qualifications for speakers are simple, have a subject of interest
to fellow technical & InfoSec people. The subject can be on technical 
or security issues, social interaction with technology, based on the
current events, or just something entertaining to our attendees.
As a speaker you can be an expert, a student, someone learning a new
area, maybe a regular speaker on the conference circuit, but we also
love to have new & occasional speakers.

Send your talk / activity proposals to <{{ site.email }}>


We also welcome occasional company pitches, to sell or recruit, but to regulate
the frequency of these we ask you to buy a round of drinks. Also please
discuss with us beforehand!
