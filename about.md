## Dates

Meetings are normally the last Tuesday of the month, except December.

New attendees welcome, just come along!
(There are no entry fees, and no tickets to book.)

## Rules

18+ Sorry, the pub's license only allows people 18 and over after 6pm.

Please be respectful to our speakers, other attendees, and the venue staff.

## Talk nights

Format is usually two talks: a primary 1 hour (ish) and,
a secondary 30 minutes (ish).
Talks start at 19:30, but we have the room from about
18:30 to 23:00.

## Speakers Wanted

Typically our programme has a technical talk (~1 hr) and lighter talk (~30 min).
Once or twice a year we have a "Lightning Talk" format, with shorter
talks up to ~15 minutes, with anyone who wants to speak on the night.

The qualifications for speakers are simple, have a subject of interest
to fellow technical & InfoSec people. The subject can be on technical 
or security issues, social interaction with technology, based on the
current events, or just something entertaining to our attendees.
As a speaker you can be an expert, a student, someone learning a new
area, maybe a regular speaker on the conference circuit, but we also
love to have new & occasional speakers.

Send your talk / activity proposals to <talks@dc4420.org>

You are very welcome to propose running activities other than talks, such
as hands-on workshop or an infosec pub quiz, or something else relevant to our
techie audience!

We also welcome occasional company pitches, to sell or recruit, but to regulate
the frequency of these we ask you to buy a round of drinks. Also please
discuss with Major Malfunction or Tony beforehand!
